# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe Game project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! In this project, we will be creating a simple Tic Tac Toe game that you can play against the computer.
Project Overview

Our Tic Tac Toe game will have a 3x3 grid of squares, where the player can click on a square to place their symbol (either an X or O), and then the computer will make its move. The game will continue until one player gets three symbols in a row, or until all squares are filled without a winner.
Technologies Used

To create this project, we will be using the following technologies:

    HTML
    CSS
    JavaScript

File Structure

Our project will consist of the following files:

 index.html: This is the main HTML file that will contain the game board and other UI elements.
 style.css: This file will contain the CSS styles for our game.
 main.js: This file will contain the JavaScript code that will handle the game logic.

HTML Structure

Our index.html file will have the following structure:

We have a title element that sets the title of the page to "Tic Tac Toe". We also have a link element that links to our style.css file.

In the body element, we have a div element with the id of "game-board". This is where our game board will be displayed. Inside the game-board div, we have nine div elements with the class of "square". These are the individual squares that make up our game board.

Finally, we have a script element that links to our main.js file, which contains the JavaScript code that will handle our game logic

CSS Styles

Our style.css file will contain the following styles:

We are setting the display property of our game-board div to "flex", which will allow us to easily align our squares in a 3x3 grid. We also set the width and height of our game board to 300 pixels and set the margin to "0 auto", which will center our game board horizontally on the page.

For our square class, we set the width and height to 100 pixels and add a border of 1 pixel solid black to give our squares a border.

JavaScript Code

Our script.js file will contain the following code:
